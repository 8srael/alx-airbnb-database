## Task 5. Partitioning Large Tables

*Objective*: Implement table partitioning to improve query performance.

##### Partitioning report

- Before Partitioning :
    - Execution Plan: Full table scan.
    - Execution Time: Slow, as all rows are examined.
- After Partitioning :
    - Execution Plan: Only the relevant partitions (e.g., p2024) are scanned.
    - Execution Time: Reduced, as only a subset of the data is analyzed.
    - Significant reduction in the number of rows scanned.
    - Queries with filters on start_date showed a *50â€“70% reduction in execution time* on large tables.
    - Index management is more efficient, as they are limited to each partition.
